JpGraph from http://jpgraph.net/
======
This is a port for Composer users to use JpGraph as a Vendor library. Forked from: https://github.com/jbfulgencio/jpgraph
Fixes:
- function __construct() for constructors
- imageantialias error fix

use JpGraph\JpGraph::load(); and JpGraph\JpGraph::module('moduleName'); to load required modules
